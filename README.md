# The statistical framework for generating boundary conditions for compound flood models

This directory contains MATLAB scripts used for estimating the return periods of compound flood drivers in coastal regions, focusing on the mixed populations (tropical cyclones (TCs) and non-tropical cyclones (non-TCs)). The methodology and results are detailed in the paper "[Funding rules that promote equity in climate adaptation outcomes](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/6ewmu)."

## Overview of Scripts
**The input and output files are generated by the MATLAB scripts (except the raw data inputs). Under the "Input" files, the file name is given first following the format of the file**

### 1. Bias Correction
- **`Bias_Correction.m`**

**Description**: This script applies a bias correction to the rainfall data using quantile mapping. The method adjusts the hourly rainfall gauge data to match the basin-average rainfall values derived from the Analysis of Record for Calibration (AORC) data.-

**Input**:
- `Pr_Measured.mat`:- [date-time, hourly precipitation]
- `Pr_AORC.mat`:- [date-time, hourly precipitation]

**output**: 
- `Bias Corrected MS at {location}_With_AORC_of_GC.mat`:- [date-time, hourly precepitation]

 
### 2. Calculating accumulated rainfall 
- **`Creating_Accumulated_RF.m`**

**Description**: The script calculates the accumulated rainfall from 1 to 48 hours suing the hourly rainfall data.
    
**Input**:

### 3. 	Defining peak-over-threshold extreme events
- **`Scripts/Creating_POT_Extremes_NTR.m`**

**Description**: The script uses the Peak over threshold (POT) approach to define events over thresholds for non-tidal residuals (NTR).
Functions: ut_solv, ut_reconstr are needed and should be downloaded through U-tide package (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46523-utide-unified-tidal-analysis-and-prediction-functions). The years with substantial data gaps are removed manually. 

**Input**:
- `Water level data` :- [date-time, hourly water levels]

**output**: 
- `POT_NTR_and_NTR_timeseries.mat` :- structure[NTR.POT.WL_raw.Tide.MovA_WL.Threshold]


- **`Scripts/Creating_POT_Extremes_RF.m`**

**Description**: The script uses the Peak over threshold (POT) approach to define events over thresholds for basin average rainfall. The code calculates the threshold exceedances for rainfall accumulation times from 1 to 48.

**Input**:
- `Hourly_accumulation_Bias_Corrected_RF_data_”location”.mat`:- [date-time, hourly accumulated Rf (nx48)]

**output**: 
- `POT_Events_for_each_RF_Accumulation_time.mat`: -structure[events[POT.Threshold]

**output**:

# The Flood Hazard Modeling using SFINCS model

In this section, we describe how to perfom the flood hazard analysis used in the paper "[Funding rules that promote equity in climate adaptation outcomes](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/6ewmu)." using the rainfall and water levels derived in the previous section. We used the SFINCS flood model, which is an open access and open source flood model developed by Deltares and can be found (10.5281/zenodo.8038534, https://github.com/Deltares/SFINCS) 

### 1. SFINCS SET UP

Documentation about the SFINCS model and how to set it up can be found (https://sfincs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 
Information about the raw input data used to set up SFINCS and the sources of the data can be found in the Supporting Material of the paper *LINK TO SUP MAT*
We used ArcGIS pro to preprocess the DEM (clip to catchments domain), the Delft Dashboard (Van Ormondt et al. 2020 https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2020.092), and the Open Earth Tools (https://svn.oss.deltares.nl/repos/openearthtools/trunk/matlab/applications/sfincs/) to generate some of the input files of SFINCS (DEM, Subgrid tables, and msk file). 
To generate the Roughness file, we converted the land cover classes to Manning coefficients using the "Mean" value of the conversion table "Unique_Land_Classes_CN.xls" in the Data_Flood_Modeling. 
The input model files of SFINCS for Gloucester City (NJ, US) used in this study can be downloaded from (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14251309).

### 2. Boundary Conditions and Rainfall Forcing

As explain in the methodlogy of "[Funding rules that promote equity in climate adaptation outcomes](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/6ewmu).", we simulated flooding from different return period events of extreme water levels and rainfall independtly. 
The boudary files of water levels and rainfall fields for SFINCS from the events derived from the Statistical Framework can be generated using the Matlab script "SFINCS_BC_generator.m" and the function "sfincs_write_netcdf_amprfile.m" from the Open Earth Tools (https://svn.oss.deltares.nl/repos/openearthtools/trunk/matlab/applications/sfincs/). 

**Input**: 
- `Design_events_Cropped_Irene_.mat`
- `Lat_lon_Time_Irene.mat`
- `Gloucester_street_light_utm.tif` in "Data_Flood_modeling"
**output**:
- `Rain_XXX.nc` (Rainfall field of event of RP XXX)
- `sfincs.bzs`  (Water Level time series of RP XXX)

### 3. Model File & Running SFINCS

In "Data_Flood_modeling" can be found one of the model files ("sfincs.inp") used for one of the SFINCS simulations. This file can be open with any text editor and contains all the information about the configuration of SFINCS used for this study. In order to run the different events, the fields "bzsfile" and "netamprfile" need to be modified accordingly with the name given to the water levels boudary file and rainfall field files generated from the previous section.  
For this study, we used the Version 2.0.0 Alpe D'Huez Release 2022 (10.5281/zenodo.8038534).
